                    <p className="mb-4">The social and retail aspect of fashion is rapidly changing. Emerging technologies and globalization of the retail space cause shoppers to spend a lot time, effort, and resources doing reseach on high end fashion goods before purchasing. There were no apps that completed the loop by tying the desire to own a premium product and flaunt them in a community, to enabling the community to materialize ownership of the products.​</p>

                    <p className="mb-5">That&#39;s where Gratify fills the gap. We leverage the style identity of users, flaunt the premium products they desire, and give them a platform to share it with other fashion-forward people</p>

                <p className="mb-5">The main social action on Gratify is to “Want” products–the equivalent of a like or pin. Users can also leave a comment on them, start a discussion, and follow people with similar interests.</p>
            
                <p className="mb-4">The app is organized into two main sections:</p>
            
                <ul className="list mb-5 pb-5">
                    <li className="mb-3">
                        <p><b>My Feed</b></p>
                        <p>Personalized products based on interest and campaigns by others you are following</p>

                        <p className="mb-5">The My Feed section is where most of the interaction happens. Users see which products the people they follow want, as well as new products in the categories they’re following.</p>

                <h3 className="my-5">Design Strategy</h3>

                <p className="mb-4">We approached this project in the way that Apple considered the redesign of their built-in apps:</p>

                <ul className="list">
                    <li className="mb-3">
                        <p><b>Strip the UI</b></p>
                        <p>First, expose the app’s core functionality and reaffirm its relevance</p>
                    </li>
                    <li className="mb-3">
                        <p><b>Use iOS themes</b></p>
                        <p>First, expose the app’s core functionality and reaffirm its relevance</p>
                    </li>
                    <li className="mb-3">
                        <p><b>Focus on content and functionality</b></p>
                        <p>Be prepared to defy precedent, question assumptions, and let a focus on content and functionality motivate every design decision</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

            </div>
            </div>

            <div className="row justify-content-md-center py-5">
            <div className="col-md-8">
                <h4 className="my-5">Branding Brief</h4>

                <p className="mb-4">The goal of our app is to seamlessly connect our users with a community that loves to discover, share and flaunt their style personas. Through research, we were able to narrow down the categories that shoppers are mostly interested in.  The 3 accessories most often gifted were shoes, bags, and watches.</p>

                <p className="mb-5">Friends will be able to pledge/contribute toward your <b>Wants</b> and ensure their gift will never be returned.</p>

            </div>
            </div>

            <div className="row justify-content-md-center mb-5">
            <div className="col-md-8">

                <h4 className="my-5">Brand Icon</h4>

                <p className="mb-5">A beautiful logo was a requirement for us. It’s not unusual for people to base their initial opinions about your app’s quality, purpose, and reliability solely on the look of your app icon. </p>

                <p className="mb-4">Our approach:</p>

                <ul className="list mb-5">
                    <li className="mb-3">
                        <p>Tell your app’s story and build an emotional connection with users</p>
                    </li>
                    <li className="mb-3">
                        <p>Be unique, uncluttered, and engaging</p>
                    </li>
                    <li className="mb-3">
                        <p>Needs to be scalable and versatile</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            
                <p>Beauty, simplicity, and versatility were the pillars for our design. I wanted to keep the logo monochromatic and explored black and white as primary colors. I realized that our content will be loud and colorful, so an understated design was crucial to avoid competing with the brand elements.</p>

                <h4 className="my-5">Brand Guidelines</h4>

                <p className="mb-4">It was important to deliver complete UI specs to ensure the quality and integrity of the app was consistent throughout the experience.</p>

                <h4 className="my-5">The Kapferer Brand Identity Prism</h4>
                
                <p className="mb-4">In 1986, professor Jean-Noël Kapferer sought to analyze the main elements that contribute to the identity of a brand. Factors like the nature of product offered, or the company name, led him to use a subset of human qualities to do this. We used this framework when sculpting our brand.</p>
